In Django, when you want to filter database records, you typically use the `filter()` method on a model's manager (like `Product.objects.filter()`). By default, when you pass multiple conditions to `filter()`, Django uses **AND** logic. This means that all conditions must be met for a record to be included in the result set.

### The Problem

When a user submits a search query, you might want to match that query against multiple fields in your model (for example, `product_name` and `product_description`). If you simply use `filter()` like this:

```python
products = Product.objects.filter(name=query, description=query)
```

This would mean that both the `name` and the `description` must contain the `query` for a product to be included in the results. This can be too restrictive. 

### Desired Logic

Instead, you might want to find products where the `query` matches either the `name` or the `description`. For this, you need to use **OR** logic.

### Using `Q` Objects

Django provides `Q` objects to allow for complex queries using both **AND** and **OR** conditions. You can import `Q` from `django.db.models` and use it to build your query.

Hereâ€™s how you can achieve the desired filtering:

```python
from django.db.models import Q

# Assuming `query` is the search term provided by the user
products = Product.objects.filter(
    Q(name__icontains=query) | Q(description__icontains=query)
)
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Importing `Q`**: You need to import `Q` from `django.db.models`.

2. **Using `Q`**:
   - `Q(name__icontains=query)`: This creates a condition to match the `name` field. The `__icontains` lookup is case-insensitive and checks if `query` is a substring of the `name`.
   - `|`: This operator represents an **OR** condition.
   - `Q(description__icontains=query)`: Similar to the above, this checks if `query` is in the `description`.

3. **Combining Conditions**: By combining these conditions with `|`, you specify that a product should be returned if it matches either condition.

### Conclusion

Using `Q` objects allows you to create more flexible and powerful queries in Django. In this case, it enables you to search for products based on user input across multiple fields, returning results that match either the product name or the description, which enhances user experience and search functionality.

The syntax `fieldname__lookup_type` is used to apply filters on specific fields in a model.
For example, name__icontains checks if the name field contains a certain substring, while name__in checks if the name field's value is within a specified list.
